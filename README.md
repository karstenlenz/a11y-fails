# a11y-fails

A demo page with intentionally bad accessibility.

## How to use
Just clone the repo and open the index.html in a browser of your choice and try to find the a11y fails. No build tools, npm or such shenanigans needed.
An improved version of the page can be found in the /improved subfolder.

You can also use these links on GitHub pages. Some tools like lighthouse don't work locally, so this might be helpful.

I added a list of a11y issues in this markdown file with the corresponding WCAG 2.1 criteria:

If you find any other issues, please let me know. 

I'm planning to expand this repo to cover more issues in the future. If you have any feedback please send me a message or leave a GitHub star :)
